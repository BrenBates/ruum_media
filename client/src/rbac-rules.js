// Static permissions are those permissions which don't need any data apart from the user role. 
// Dynamic permissions are permissions which need additional data to determine access. 
// Static permissions are helpful when, for example, you have to allow write access to writers and admins only. 
// Dynamic permissions are helpful when, for example, you have only to allow the writer who is the owner of a resource to edit that resource.

// Permissions are defined in the format of resource:action
